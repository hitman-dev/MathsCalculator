# tkinter

The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems

# functools

The functools module is for higher-order functions: functions that act on or return other functions. 

In general, any callable object can be treated as a function for the purposes of this module.
